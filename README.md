# Principal Component Analysis (example using weather data)
A project regarding the concept of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a method for reducing the dimension of massive data sets onto a projected vector  

Using Python and the MatPlotLib library, I created a program that took vectors, calculated their projections, and plotted those projections on a predetermined line.
